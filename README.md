<h1 align="center">Steps to Follow</h1>
 - Main idea is the deploy of a HoneyPot with Visualization in Azure. 
 - Deploy a virtual machine in Azure leaving it unprotected on purpose to be seen by any attacker.
 - Run PowerShell ISE Script to be used inside the virtual machine to detect attacks.
 - Log Analytics WorkSpace where we will tell it which is the machine we want to extract the data and where the logs are located.
 - Run the query to be used on Sentinel within the Analytics Workspace.
 - Deploy SIEM within Azure Sentinel.
 - Review of the attacks received in Azure.
